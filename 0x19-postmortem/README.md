- 1:05 PM (PDT) — Technical team alerted to the issue.
- 1:10 PM (PDT) — Engineers began diagnostics, suspecting a DDoS attack or unexpected traffic surge.
- 2:00 PM (PDT) — Traffic logs analyzed, identifying a significant increase in legitimate traffic.
- 2:15 PM (PDT) — Misleading assumption of DDoS attack ruled out.
- 2:30 PM (PDT) — Issue escalated to the infrastructure team.
- 3:00 PM (PDT) — Additional server resources allocated.
- 4:30 PM (PDT) — Traffic managed with load balancers, improving response times.
- 5:30 PM (PDT) — Full website functionality and performance restored.

# Root Cause and Resolution
## Root Cause:
- The slow response times and timeouts were due to a sudden spike in legitimate traffic from a successful marketing campaign, which overwhelmed the server resources.

## Resolution:

- Identified Traffic Surge: Traffic logs revealed a significant increase due to the marketing campaign.
- Resource Allocation: Additional server resources were allocated to handle the increased load.
- Load Balancing: Implemented load balancers to distribute traffic effectively, restoring normal performance.
- Corrective and Preventative Measures
- Improvements Needed:

- Traffic Management: Enhance ability to handle sudden traffic spikes.
- Resource Scaling: Improve infrastructure scalability and response.
- Monitoring: Enhance traffic monitoring and alerts.
- Tasks to Address the Issue:

- Implement auto-scaling policies for server resources.
- Improve traffic load balancing configurations.
- Enhance monitoring tools to better detect and analyze traffic patterns.
- Conduct load testing simulations to prepare for high traffic events.
- Develop a protocol for rapid resource allocation during traffic surges.
- Create detailed documentation for traffic management strategies.
- Train the technical team on handling high traffic scenarios.
- Schedule regular reviews of infrastructure capacity and scalability.
- By following these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to improve our system's resilience and ensure a better user experience during future high traffic events.
